<p class="quote">&#8220;So, there is a problem with accounting.
Here's the long and short of it.</p>

<p>The host runs at <code>HZ</code> ticks per second. Unless you changed it (and
you likely did not), that&#39;s 100 ticks per second. This means the
smallest granularity of time that can be quantized inside the VM
is &#34;slightly less&#34; than 100 ticks per second. And of course, you
can&#39;t fire 100 ticks into the guest (for each guest) if the host
itself is only receiving 100 opportunities to do that per second.</p>

<p>Similarly, each RTC in the guest expects a periodic timer firing
at 128 Hz.  Clearly <em>that</em> can&#39;t be accomplished if the host itself
is only scheduling at 100 Hz.</p>

<p>What this leads to is errors in accounting since the guest kernels
don&#39;t have a consistent view of time. What you&#39;ll likely see is odd
numbers for the &#34;rate&#34; column in <code>vmstat -zi</code>.</p>

<p>This is fairly harmless, but could be contributing to the &#34;87%&#34;
interrupt number. I bet you actually aren&#39;t running 87% interrupt
load there, but the accounting is confused because of the skewed
timer.</p>

<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ol start="1">
<li><p>Update to <code>-current</code>, I fixed some of the egergious problems in
asserted PIC lines in slovenia last month. (There are still more
to fix though).</p></li>
<li><p><em>As an experiment on a spare machine</em> (if you have one), build
a HOST kernel using <code>HZ=1000</code> (this can be set in sys&#47;conf&#47;param.c
before make config), or use the <code>-DHZ=xxx</code> build parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Boot to that kernel on the host and verify you&#39;re getting
<code>1000 * ncpus</code> &#34;clock&#34; interrupts via <code>vmstat -zi</code> (again, on the HOST):</p>

<pre><code>irq0&#47;clock      14398951    3999
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example for my 4 CPU machine</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Use regular 100 HZ kernels in the guest, and you should see some
of these issues go away.</p>

<p>So, why don&#39;t we make 1,000 Hz the default? Well, consider you run a
1,000 Hz host and a 1,000 Hz guest ... you&#39;re back in the same problem
again. What really is needed here is a deadline scheduler (something
like Linux&#39;s tickless model) to handle arbitrary guest timer
granularities. This is hard and is something dlg@ and I have been
working on but it&#39;s not ready. A 1,000 Hz (or even 2,000 Hz) host is
the stopgap measure until that&#39;s done.</p>

<p>Again, aside from cosmetic issues, I don&#39;t think this is causing
you or the users any real pain, just wanted to explain what I think
is going on.&#8221;</p>
